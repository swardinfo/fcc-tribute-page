                    <p>Florey's research team had improved the production of the mould and
                        efficient extraction of the active ingredient, to the point where it had become an industrial process

                        Alexander Fleming. Fleming first observed the antibiotic properties of the mould that makes
                        penicillin, but it was Chain and Florey who developed it into a useful treatment.</p>
